// Package toolbox contains various helper and utility functions that the
// library uses. The gut reaction is to call this "toolbox" but it's not an
// exhaustive collection of utilities but rather a collection small helper
// functions that keeps on proving useful.It's not too different from a toolbox
// in the corner of the workshop with all sorts of mangled tools modified to
// fit a particular purpose :)
